    title: "Attack of the mutants - using mutant testing to improve your unit test suite"
    intro: "Code without tests is code that is going to sneak up behind you while you’re texting on your phone,  put glue in your hair and steal your lucky horseshoe from your bag. Evil! But how can you find those dastardly lines? Traditionally we’ve used test coverage metrics (e.g. Istanbul) to track down those villains but coverage has a lot of gaps. A test can execute 100% of code without performing any assertions, giving you a false sense of security. What's the solution then? Fight back against those villains by unleashing mutants! Don't worry, you don't have to drink radioactive coolaid, we're talking about mutation testing. It involves using a tool like StrykerJS to programatically insert bugs (mutants) into your code and check whether the tests catch them."

    title: "Hacking FLOW for software engineers"
    intro: "I'm going to introduce you to something that you probably all know, but don't, and how it enables you to be 5x more productive, up to 7x more creative and potentially be the secret to happiness. This is especially applicable to software engineers because I guarantee you have been "in the zone" I'm going to show you how you can use it to your advantage, not to let it over power your life and surrcumb to the dark-side and use to its full potential and enjoy it for what it is."
  - time: "7:50pm"

    title: "Real World Usage of Stamps"
    intro: "Often I was asked to show some real world usage of stamps. In last few months I collected some cool (and some boring) code examples of how people use stamps. I was surprised to see all the variety of ways people approach stamps. In the talk I'll quickly show how stamps work and then will walk through a bunch of examples."
