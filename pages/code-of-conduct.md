# Code of conduct

All delegates, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at any <strong>Node Sydney</strong> event are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event.

### The Quick Version

Node Sydney is dedicated to providing a harassment-free meetup experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any meetup venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Meetup participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the meetup at the discretion of the organisers.

### The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the meetup organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the meetup.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact one of the organisers immediately.

Organisers will be happy to help participants contact the venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all meetup venues and meetup-related social events.
