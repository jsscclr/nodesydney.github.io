## 6:30pm CSP HSTS HPKP CORS XFO WTH HTTP

So many security headers and so easy to get them wrong. In this presentation, I will talk about top 5 HTTP Response security headers, how we can benefit from them and how to implement them correctly in NodeJS. I will also show bad or incorrect usage of these headers in real-world. The content of this presentation is based on my experience assessing security of many web applications and web services as well as common insecure patterns that I come across.
