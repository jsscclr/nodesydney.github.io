## 6:30pm Functional programming in JS

What happened in the year after Angular was finally released? We'll touch on the key features of Angular, how to generate a boilerplate with Angular CLI, how to produce dev and prod builds out of the box, etc.

We'll also cover Angular Material2, CDK and other UI libraries developers can use with Angular. Finally we'll see how you can manage the application state of an Angular app and demonstrate how to call a Node.js API.
