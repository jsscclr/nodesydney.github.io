<h1>Sponsorship</h1>

<em>Node Sydney</em> only exists thanks to

- our awesome attendees
- the hard-woring organisers
- our sponsors!

A massive thanks to the many great Australian or global companies have been supporting us since the beginning.
Thanks for all the effort helping us organise the events, as well as providing a meeting space, and food and drinks to keep everyone energised throughout the evenings.

<h2>Becoming a sponsor</h2>

We are not looking for sponsors at the moment.
If you are interested in sponsoring the meetup in the future, please get in touch.

**Our obligations to sponsors**

- We will ensure people are aware of the positive impact you're having on the local community
- We will work with you in advance to find a suitable time and schedule
- We will ensure the meetup space is left clean at the end of the event

**What we expect of sponsors**

Official sponsors are expected to

- Host 4 meetups every year. The indicative cost of hosting a meetup is AUD 1200 which includes pizzas, beers and soft drinks.
- Participate in sundry expenses up to AUD 200 per year (e.g. [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) organiser fee, web hosting, banners).
